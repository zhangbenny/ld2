# ld2

- This has been written in es6 (files in the "src" folder) and compiles those files to es5 at the "public/js/" folder
- If you have babel-cli, you could continue to work on the src folder in es6. To recompile and start the server, use:

```
npm start
```
- The program is purely front-end and requires no package handling, so the use of the server is not necessary and can simply be run with a browser by opening:
```
index.html
```
